                        A good mid-priced car, in my opinion is the BMW 4 series. The 4 series started out when BMW realised that instead of the 3 series sedan and 3 series coupe they can create a whole new series, the 4th which resulted in the first model The f32 4 series and the f82 M4. It is a relatively fresh line which basically resembles a 3 series but in the coupe version although it does come in a 4 door version which for me does not make any sense. The reason I like the 4 series is beacuse of the price and the usability. Firstly you can get a 430I or 440I from 2016-2018 at around 30k so it is a relatively cheap car taking in the consideration what it offers, moreover the usability is good because this is an everyday car but you still have the power under the hood when you want to drift or take it around the circuit.

                        A car that does not have any flaws in my opinion is the Mercedes G class, the new one (w463) especially the G63 AMG version. In my opinion it has everything, power, interior space, cargo space, it's luxurious it's a SUV, etc.. The exterior design is also flawless, Mercedes really hit the jackpot with this one and it's quite the jump from last version's design, it's just so smoother than the last version. The reason I like it is because, for a SUV it has a lot of power, it feels like a beast, and also Mercedes didn't cut any corners while designing and building it and in my opinion the G class surpasses Lamborghini Urus, BMW X7, Bentley Bentayga, Rolls-Royce Cullinan and every other class considered part of this class, by a lot, also managing to not be the most expensive one and I can only hope to own such a car one day.

                        The only exotic car on this list: The Porsche 911 more specifically my favourite ones is the Carrera S and the Turbo S. What's not to like, it looks like a UFO inside-out, it looks fast and aggressive the design, it's unique, it does not look like anything else, It's a legendary car. The design is sleek, the interior is luxurious, it's a coupe, a sports car, it's a Porsche, every inch of the car screams luxury and performance. The reason I like it is because of its history, personally I am a fan of every 911 generation and version even the 996 which is the least popular one, however for me the 992 Carrera S and Turbo S are the holy grail. These 2 versions are not the most expensive ones and for that matter not the best ones either but for me the gt2rs or gt3rs looks like Porsche wanted to follow the stereotype of a "sporty" car with the way that the spoiler, fenders and paintjob was done, whereas the Turbo S for example is much more Elegant

                        The last but not the least the BMW 8 and M8 series. The 8 series has its roots in the 90s, the E31 8 series. It was a success and rumor has it that BMW waas working on a M8 version and there were some prototypes mut it did not go further than that, however the new version the G14/G15/G16 is a massive succes for BMW, as for all the cars in this article, the design is magnificent, everything about it is just perfect, it's agressive but at the same time sleek, it's sporty but it's elegant, every detail of it is perfectly done by BMW. Personally i like the hard-top coupe version but I don't dislike the others as well, it's just that this version is more apropriate to my perception of a sports car and also a good reason to buy this car is the practicality, as in the BMW 4 series case its an everyday car but it has the power for when you want to drive it around the circuit and also drift.
